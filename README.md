# Phenotype- and genotype-based estimates of genetic risk
Code for the analyses presented in "The relationship between genotype- and phenotype-based estimates of genetic liability to psychiatric disorders, in practice and in theory"

Core functions are found in the [PA-FGRS library](https://github.com/BioPsyk/PAFGRS). 

Figure1.R and Figure6.R require access to iPSYCH data, which cannot be made publicly available.
